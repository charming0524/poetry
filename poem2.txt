“Hope is the thing with feathers", by Charming
I’ve heard it in the chillest land -

And on the strangest Sea -

Yet - never - in Extremity,

It asked a crumb - of me.

The evocative extended metaphor at the heart of this work has helped to cement "Hope is a thing with feathers" as perhaps the best-loved of Dickinson's 1,800 poems. In the last stanza, Dickinson beautifully captures the ever-giving, selfless nature of hope⁠— the bird of hope sings in the harshest, most adverse times in our lives, never asking for anything in return.
